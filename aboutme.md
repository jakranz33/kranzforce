Why am I taking the time to write a blog in the first place?  I've been in the Risk Management, Insurance, and Safety software business for much of my career, and for the past 3 years, I've been working for a company that delivers their solutions in this space as a Salesforce partner, built on the Force.com platform.  From day one, I was hooked by how much could be easily built and customized.  Entire enterprise-class applications, built and deployed in mere hours!  As I began learning the ins and outs of the platform, I found that the community of blogs was crucial to my education.  Now, with a bit of experience under my belt, I felt it was time that I contributed back to that community.  Thus my blog, which I have crudely dubbed KranzForce, is born.  I plan to post tips, tricks, anecdotes, and other nonsense as it pertains to building things on Salesforce.com and its array of tools from button-click administration to leveraging Apex, VisualForce, Lightning, and JavaScript/HTML/CSS.  

If just one person stumbles across one of my posts as they scour the internet looking to solve a problem they are facing, and my post helps them along, then I'll have achieved my goal.  Thanks for reading!
