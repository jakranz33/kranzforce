You can write regular [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.

**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

I can provide code samples using inline code blocks like this: `<apex:pageBlock>` for blog posts, or even separate code blocks like this:

    var someVariable;
    var someFunctionVariable = function(x) {
      someVariable = x;
    }

Here is an example of "Block Quotes"

> Some passage that someone else wrote that I want to Quotes

And I can include images:
