This is my first post, how exciting! For such an occasion, it only makes sense to outline what I'd like to achieve by having this thing in the first place.

Why am I taking the time to write a blog in the first place?  I've been in the Risk Management, Insurance, and Safety software business for much of my career, and for the past 3 years, I've been working for a company that delivers their solutions in this space as a Salesforce partner, built on the Force.com platform.  From day one, I was hooked by how much could be easily built and customized.  Entire enterprise-class applications, built and deployed in mere hours!  As I began learning the ins and outs of the platform, I found that the community of blogs was crucial to my education.  Now, with a bit of experience under my belt, I felt it was time that I contributed back to that community.  Thus my blog, which I have crudely dubbed KranzForce, is born.  I plan to post tips, tricks, anecdotes, and other nonsense as it pertains to building things on Salesforce.com and its array of tools from button-click administration to leveraging Apex, VisualForce, Lightning, and JavaScript/HTML/CSS.  

If just one person stumbles across one of my posts as they scour the internet looking to solve a problem they are facing, and my post helps them along, then I'll have achieved my goal.  Thanks for reading!
