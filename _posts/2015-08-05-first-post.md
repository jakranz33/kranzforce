This is my first post, how exciting! For such an occasion, it only makes sense to outline what I'd like to achieve by having this thing in the first place.

### Why am I even doing this?  

Well, let's start with some context: I've been in the Risk Management, Insurance, and Safety software business for much of my career, and for the past 3 years, I've been working for a company that delivers their solutions in this space as a Salesforce partner, built on the Force.com platform.  From day one, I was hooked by how much could be easily built and customized.  Entire enterprise-class applications, built and deployed in mere hours!  As I began learning the ins and outs of the platform, I found that the online community of blogs was crucial to my education.  

Today, with a bit of experience under my belt, I feel it is time that I contribute back to that community.  Thus is born my blog, which I have crudely dubbed KranzForce.  I plan to post tips, tricks, anecdotes, and other nonsense as it pertains to building things on Salesforce.com and its array of button-click administration tools to leveraging Apex, VisualForce, Lightning, and JavaScript/HTML/CSS.  

### What do I hope to achieve?

If just one person stumbles across one of my posts as they scour the internet looking to solve a problem they are facing, and my post helps them along, then I'll have achieved my goal.  Thanks for reading!

### When do I want it?

Now!

Hah, quite frankly, between family, work, and a new home (with its always-growing to-do list), it might be a bit of a struggle to post content on a regular basis.
